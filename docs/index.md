# Musoq: SQL-like Querying for Various Data Sources

Musoq is a tool that lets developers and IT professionals query different data sources using SQL-like syntax, without needing to import data into a database first. It's designed for scenarios where you need to analyze files, directories, archives, or other data sources quickly and efficiently.

## What Musoq Does

- Provides SQL-like querying capability for files, directories, archives, and other data sources
- Supports various data formats including CSV, JSON, flat files, and more
- Enables AI-assisted analysis through integration with models like GPT and Llama
- Offers both CLI and programmatic access
- Works on Windows and Linux, with planned MacOS support

## Practical Applications

Musoq is particularly useful for:
- Analyzing source code and solution files
- Exploring file systems and comparing directories
- Processing CSV and JSON data
- Extracting information from archives
- Analyzing images and text using AI models
- Querying CAN DBC files
- Processing system data and logs

## Current State

Musoq focuses on handling small to medium-sized datasets efficiently. While it uses SQL-like syntax, it intentionally deviates from strict SQL standards when it benefits user experience. The project prioritizes:

- Quick, ad-hoc data querying
- User-friendly syntax over strict standards
- Read-only operations
- Continuous improvement based on real-world usage

## Getting Started

The fastest way to try Musoq is through the [CLI tool](https://github.com/Puchaczov/Musoq.CLI). The CLI provides immediate access to Musoq's querying capabilities and supports multiple output formats including Raw, CSV, JSON, and Interpreted JSON.
