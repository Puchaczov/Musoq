# Introduction

In this section, we will try to demonstrate practical examples of use along with basic explanations of how they work - this will be useful not only to you, the user browsing through this documentation, but also to me - the author who will certainly forget many things over time and, with a bit of hope, will have the opportunity to remind himself of the details when he will need to construct a query that will help him in his work.

What you can expect in this section:

1. **Examples of queries with basic explanation**: These will be selected examples that should meaningfully reflect how to construct queries, how to manipulate data or will showcase examples of using non-standard syntax.
2. **Diverse data sources**: The presented examples will refer to different data sources so that you have the chance to familiarize yourself with the capabilities of this tool.
3. **Practical usage examples** to make it clear what are the drawbacks and what are the advantages of this tool.
4. **Tips & tricks**: Sometimes, certain things can be done differently, or simply better; we will try to do just that.

This section will be updated regularly as soon as new queries that bring something new in the way of using the tool appear. I encourage you to experiment on your own, share examples, and explore new possibilities in using the tool.
