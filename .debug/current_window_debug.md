# Major Breakthrough - Window Function Issue Root Cause Identified

## ‚úÖ BREAKTHROUGH: Found the exact issue preventing aggregate window functions

### Key Discovery
Window functions (`SUM() OVER`, `COUNT() OVER`, `AVG() OVER`) are being processed correctly until a specific point where the window function marker gets lost:

1. ‚úÖ **Parser**: `SUM(Population) OVER (...)` correctly parses as WindowFunctionNode
2. ‚úÖ **WindowFunctionNode Visitor**: Gets called and creates AccessMethodNode with window function marker
3. ‚ùå **Marker Loss**: The AccessMethodNode with marker gets replaced by a new AccessMethodNode without marker
4. ‚ùå **Aggregate Rewriting**: The unmarked AccessMethodNode gets treated as regular aggregate, causing null argument error

### Debug Evidence
```
DEBUG: WindowFunctionNode.Visit called for SUM ‚úÖ
DEBUG: Creating AccessMethodNode with window function marker for SUM ‚úÖ  
DEBUG: Processing aggregate method SUM, isWindowFunction: False ‚ùå
DEBUG: ExtraAggregateArguments is null ‚ùå
```

### Root Cause
Between `BuildMetadataAndInferTypesVisitor` and `RewriteFieldWithGroupMethodCallBase`, another visitor is recreating the AccessMethodNode and losing the ExtraAggregateArguments window function marker.

### Next Steps
1. Find which visitor is recreating the AccessMethodNode
2. Preserve the window function marker through all visitor phases
3. Complete aggregate window function implementation

### Current Status
- **Basic window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK)**: ‚úÖ 100% working
- **Aggregate window functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG OVER)**: üîß Issue isolated, ready for final fix
- **Parser support**: ‚úÖ 95% complete (38/40 tests)
- **Window specifications (PARTITION BY, ROWS BETWEEN)**: ‚úÖ Infrastructure complete
