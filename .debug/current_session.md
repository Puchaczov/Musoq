# Debug Session - Window Functions Implementation Progress

## Compilation Status
✅ **FIXED**: Duplicate `Visit(WindowSpecificationNode node)` method error
- Removed duplicate method at line 1637 in BuildMetadataAndInferTypesVisitor.cs
- Kept more comprehensive implementation at line 1762
- All builds now succeed

## Test Status Summary

### Parser Tests (Window Functions)
- **Total**: 25 tests
- **Passing**: 23 tests (92% success rate)
- **Failing**: 2 tests
  - Parse_WindowFunctionWithQuotedIdentifiers_ShouldWork (quote handling issue)
  - Parse_WindowFunctionWithExcessiveWhitespace_ShouldWork (FROM clause parsing)

### Evaluator Tests (Window Functions)  
- **Total**: 10 tests
- **Passing**: 6 tests (60% success rate)
- **Failing**: 4 tests (all aggregate window functions)
  - SumOver_WithWindow_ShouldWork
  - CountOver_WithWindow_ShouldWork (inferred from error pattern)
  - AvgOver_WithWindow_ShouldWork
  - MixedAggregateWindowFunctions_ShouldWork

## Critical Issue Identified
**"From node is null" Error**: All aggregate window function tests failing with same error
- Error occurs in BuildMetadataAndInferTypesVisitor.Visit(QueryNode node) at line 1154
- Stack trace shows issue in QueryNode FROM clause processing
- This is blocking aggregate window functions: SUM() OVER, COUNT() OVER, AVG() OVER

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be in the QueryNode processing where the FROM clause is null when processing window functions. This suggests the parser or AST construction might not be properly setting up the query structure for window function queries.

## Next Actions Planned
1. Investigate QueryNode FROM clause handling for window functions
2. Debug the specific test case that's failing
3. Implement proper window function execution logic
4. Continue with advanced features: true PARTITION BY, ROWS BETWEEN, aggregate functions

## Advanced Features Status
- **PARTITION BY**: Infrastructure complete, execution logic needed
- **ROWS BETWEEN**: Parsing complete (100%), execution logic needed  
- **Aggregate Window Functions**: Method resolution complete, execution integration needed

## Parser Infrastructure Status
- OVER clause parsing: ✅ Working (92% success rate)
- Window frame syntax: ✅ Complete (100% success rate)
- AST nodes: ✅ Complete (WindowFunctionNode, WindowSpecificationNode, WindowFrameNode)
- Visitor pattern: ✅ Complete (all 22+ visitor classes support window functions)
