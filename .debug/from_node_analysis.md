# Critical Issue Analysis: "From node is null" Error

## Problem Description
Aggregate window functions (SUM() OVER, COUNT() OVER, AVG() OVER) are failing with "From node is null" error during BuildMetadataAndInferTypesVisitor.Visit(QueryNode node) execution.

## Working vs Failing Patterns

### Working (6 tests passing):
```sql
-- Basic window functions WITHOUT OVER clause
SELECT RANK() FROM entities
SELECT DenseRank() FROM entities  
SELECT Lag(Country, 1, 'DEFAULT') FROM entities
SELECT Lead(Country, 1, 'DEFAULT') FROM entities
```

### Failing (4 tests failing):
```sql
-- Aggregate functions WITH OVER clause
SELECT SUM(Population) OVER (ORDER BY Population) FROM entities
SELECT COUNT(Population) OVER (PARTITION BY Country) FROM entities
SELECT AVG(Population) OVER (PARTITION BY Country) FROM entities
```

## Root Cause Hypothesis
The issue appears to be in stack management during AST traversal. When processing aggregate window functions with OVER clauses:

1. **Normal Query Processing**: The QueryNode.Visit expects to pop FromNode from stack
2. **Window Function Processing**: The WindowFunctionNode processing may be consuming stack elements incorrectly
3. **Stack Imbalance**: When QueryNode.Visit is called, FromNode is missing from stack

## Technical Analysis
Location: `BuildMetadataAndInferTypesVisitor.Visit(QueryNode node)` line 1154
- Stack operation: `var from = Nodes.Pop() as FromNode;`
- Check: `if (from is null) throw new FromNodeIsNull();`
- This suggests window function processing is disrupting normal stack management

## Investigation Plan
1. Debug stack contents during window function processing
2. Check WindowFunctionNode visitor implementation
3. Verify traversal visitor handles window functions correctly  
4. Fix stack management to preserve FromNode

## Expected Solution
The fix likely involves ensuring that:
- Window function processing doesn't consume the FromNode prematurely
- Stack management is consistent between basic and aggregate window functions
- AST traversal order is preserved for OVER clause processing
