# Test Fixes Progress Report

## Current Status After Fixes

### ‚úÖ Parser Tests: 164/164 (100% passing) - PERFECT
All parser tests including window function syntax are working perfectly.

### üîß Converter Tests: 19/20 (95% passing) - Almost Fixed
- ‚úÖ Fixed arithmetic operations with window functions (object/int type mapping)
- ‚úÖ Fixed ToString method resolution (case sensitivity issue)
- ‚úÖ Fixed UPPER method alias 
- ‚úÖ Fixed DENSE_RANK method alias
- ‚ùå 1 remaining failure: currentRowStats variable scope issue in complex expressions

### ‚ùå Evaluator Tests: Many failing due to broader issues
- Same currentRowStats scope issue affecting multiple tests
- Type conversion issues (Int32 vs Int64)
- Method resolution problems
- Group value access issues

## Issues Fixed So Far

1. **Arithmetic Type Mapping**: Added missing object/primitive type combinations to BinaryTypes dictionary
2. **Method Resolution Case Sensitivity**: Fixed inconsistent use of uppercase vs original case in method lookup
3. **ToString Method**: Already existed in LibraryBaseToString.cs - no duplicate needed
4. **UPPER Method**: Added Upper() alias to LibraryBaseStrings.cs
5. **DENSE_RANK Method**: Added Dense_Rank() alias to LibraryBase.cs

## Remaining Core Issue: currentRowStats Variable Scope

The main blocker is that window functions in complex expressions (like CASE statements) can't access the `currentRowStats` variable that's generated for QueryStats injection. This affects:

- Window functions in CASE expressions
- Complex nested window function usage
- Multiple evaluator tests unrelated to window functions

### Root Cause
The `currentRowStats` variable is generated at the select processing level, but when window functions are used in nested expressions, that variable isn't in the right scope. The window function converter creates AccessMethodNode instances that require QueryStats injection, but the variable isn't available.

### Potential Solutions
1. Modify scope generation to ensure currentRowStats is available at expression level
2. Create non-injected versions of window functions for complex expressions
3. Rework the window function conversion to handle injection differently

## Impact Assessment

- Window function core functionality: ‚úÖ Working (basic cases pass)
- SQL parsing: ‚úÖ Perfect (100% parser tests pass)
- Code generation: üîß Almost working (95% converter tests pass)
- Execution: ‚ùå Affected by scope issue (evaluator tests failing)

The window function implementation itself is solid, but there's a systems integration issue with variable scoping that affects broader test suites.
