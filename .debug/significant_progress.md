# SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS: Window Functions Stack Management Fix

## Major Breakthrough
Fixed critical stack management issue in window function processing:

### Problem Identified
- Window function argument processing was not properly managing the stack
- Instead of popping ArgsListNode from stack like other access methods, it was using node.Arguments directly
- This left extra items on the stack, causing "From node is null" errors

### Fix Implemented
Enhanced WindowFunctionNode Visit method in BuildMetadataAndInferTypesVisitor:
- Now properly pops arguments from stack like other access methods
- Handles both ArgsListNode and individual argument cases
- Reconstructs ArgsListNode when needed for proper method resolution

### Current Status
- **Basic Window Functions**: ✅ 6/6 tests passing (RANK, DenseRank, Lag, Lead)
- **Aggregate Window Functions**: ❌ 4/4 tests still failing (SUM, COUNT, AVG OVER)
- **Error Type**: Improved from stack corruption to consistent "From node is null"

### Next Steps
The remaining issue is that the WindowSpecification processing (OVER clause) is still affecting the FROM node positioning. Need to investigate how the OVER clause processing interacts with stack management.

### Code Changes Made
1. Fixed duplicate Visit(WindowSpecificationNode) method
2. Enhanced CreateFields method with better error handling
3. Fixed WindowFunctionNode argument processing to match other access methods
4. Added comprehensive debugging infrastructure

## Key Insight
The distinction between basic window functions (working) and aggregate window functions with OVER clauses (failing) confirms that the OVER clause processing specifically is the remaining issue.
