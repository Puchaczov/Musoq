# BREAKTHROUGH: Stack Debug Analysis

## Critical Finding
The stack debug output shows exactly what's wrong:

**Expected stack for QueryNode processing:**
`[OrderByNode, SelectNode, FromNode]` (3 items)

**Actual stack with window functions:**
`[OrderByNode, SelectNode, ArgsListNode, FieldNode, ExpressionFromNode]` (5 items)

## Root Cause Identified
1. **Extra Stack Items**: `ArgsListNode` and `FieldNode` are extra items left by window function processing
2. **Wrong FROM Type**: `ExpressionFromNode` instead of `FromNode` 
3. **Stack Corruption**: Window function processing is not managing the stack correctly

## The Problem
When processing window functions, the visitor is pushing extra nodes (`ArgsListNode`, `FieldNode`) onto the stack that aren't being consumed by the SelectNode processing. This shifts the entire stack, causing:
- FROM node to be in the wrong position
- QueryNode to pop the wrong items in the wrong order

## Solution Strategy
Need to fix the window function processing to ensure it:
1. Doesn't leave extra items on the stack
2. Properly manages argument processing 
3. Maintains stack balance during field processing

## Immediate Fix
The issue is likely in the WindowFunctionNode visitor or how ArgsListNode is being processed. Need to check that window function argument processing doesn't leave extra stack items.
