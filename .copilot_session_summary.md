# Copilot Session Summary

## Last Updated  
2025-01-27 22:45:00 - üîç INVESTIGATING ROOT CAUSE: `:1` KeyNotFoundException in PIVOT runtime execution

## Completed Tasks
- [x] **‚úÖ FIXED EMPTY VARIABLE NAMES**: Resolved malformed C# like `var  = provider.GetSchema("#A");`
- [x] **‚úÖ FIXED VARIABLE REDEFINITION**: Eliminated CS0128 errors by preventing duplicate schema variable creation
- [x] **‚úÖ FIXED INVALID EXPRESSIONS**: Resolved CS1525 "Invalid expression terminator" and CS0103 "Name doesn't exist" errors
- [x] **üéØ ADVANCED TO RUNTIME PHASE**: Now generating valid C# syntax that compiles successfully
- [x] **üìà MAJOR PROGRESS**: Moved from compilation errors to runtime execution phase
- [x] **üîç IDENTIFIED CORE ISSUE**: Runtime `KeyNotFoundException: ':1'` in `ComputeTable_p_0_0` at line 29

## Current Status
- **Build status**: ‚úÖ **Successful** - all components compile cleanly with valid C# generation  
- **C# Compilation**: ‚úÖ **WORKING** - no more CS0128, CS0103, CS1525 syntax errors
- **Test results**: **4/31 PIVOT tests passing (13%)** - 1 pass (`PivotWithJoin`), 27 failures with `:1` error
- **Current Challenge**: Runtime lookup of `:1` key that doesn't exist in metadata dictionaries

## Root Issue: KeyNotFoundException Analysis
**Error Pattern**:
```
System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: The given key ':1' was not present in the dictionary.
   at Query.Compiled_X.CompiledQuery.ComputeTable_p_0_0(...) in :line 29
```

**Investigation Findings**:
- `:1` pattern suggests positional identifier (similar to `::1` in FieldLinkNode)
- Error occurs in compiled C# at runtime, not during compilation  
- Issue is in `positionalEnvironmentVariables` or `queriesInformation` dictionary lookup
- GROUP BY works fine with same SalesEntity schema, PIVOT fails
- Pattern suggests metadata building issue specific to PIVOT

## Next Steps
- [ ] **üîß IDENTIFY `:1` SOURCE**: Find where `:1` key is generated in PIVOT C# code
- [ ] **üîç DEBUG METADATA BUILDING**: Compare PIVOT vs GROUP BY metadata generation
- [ ] **üìä FIX KEY GENERATION**: Ensure PIVOT metadata properly populates required keys
- [ ] **‚úÖ COMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY**: Achieve working PIVOT operations with correct results

## Context Notes
- **Architecture understanding**: `positionalEnvironmentVariables` populated during `BuildMetadataAndInferTypesVisitor`
- **PIVOT infrastructure**: Parser, AST nodes, visitor methods, metadata building all implemented
- **Runtime phase**: C# compilation works, but runtime context resolution missing `:1` key
