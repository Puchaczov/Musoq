## Last Updated
2025-01-27 20:45:00 - üéØ IDENTIFIED ROOT ISSUE: C# syntax generation problem, not column resolution

## Completed Tasks
- [x] **üéØ FIXED VARIABLE REGISTRATION PATTERN**: Eliminated duplicate variable declarations by using only `_getRowsSourceStatement.Add()` pattern (following exact `AccessMethodFromNode` implementation)
- [x] **üéØ RULED OUT COLUMN RESOLUTION HYPOTHESIS**: Both qualified (`p.Books`) and unqualified (`Books`) column names fail with same CS1525/CS0128/CS0103 errors
- [x] **üéØ IDENTIFIED WORKING PATTERNS**:
  - ‚úÖ `SELECT *` FROM PIVOT works (DebugPivotMethodResolution test passes)  
  - ‚úÖ JOIN + PIVOT with specific columns works (PivotWithJoin_ShouldReturnCorrectResults passes)
  - ‚ùå `SELECT specific_columns` FROM simple PIVOT fails with C# compilation errors

## Current Status
- Build status: **Successful** - all components compile cleanly
- **PIVOT infrastructure: ‚úÖ COMPLETE** - method resolution, metadata building, schema creation all working
- **Core issue identified**: C# syntax generation malformation in simple FROM + PIVOT scenarios

**Critical insight**: The issue is NOT with:
- Variable registration pattern (fixed)
- Column name resolution (qualified vs unqualified both fail)  
- PIVOT metadata building (comprehensive and working)
- Method resolution (Sum/Count/Avg work correctly)

**Root cause**: Systematic C# code generation issue specific to simple FROM + PIVOT that creates:
- CS1525: Invalid expression terminator "."
- CS0128: Variable "InferredInfoTable", "Rows" redefinition
- CS0103: Name "var" doesn't exist

## Next Steps
- [ ] **DEBUG C# SYNTAX GENERATION**: The issue is in malformed C# code being generated, need to examine actual generated code
- [ ] **COMPARE WORKING VS FAILING PATTERNS**: 
  - Understand why `SELECT *` FROM PIVOT works vs `SELECT columns` FROM PIVOT 
  - Understand why JOIN + PIVOT works vs simple FROM + PIVOT
- [ ] **IDENTIFY SYNTAX GENERATION BUG**: Find where malformed "." expressions and variable redefinitions are coming from

## Context Notes
- **Excellent diagnostic progress**: Successfully narrowed down from 6 potential issues to 1 specific C# generation problem
- **Architecture understanding**: PIVOT infrastructure is complete and functional - issue is final syntax generation phase
- **Key working tests**: `PivotWithJoin_ShouldReturnCorrectResults` and `DebugPivotMethodResolution` provide working patterns to compare against
