# Copilot Session Summary

## Last Updated
2026-01-09T15:42:30Z - allow-shortened-join-syntax

## Completed Tasks
- Added support for treating bare `JOIN` as `INNER JOIN` while keeping whitespace handling consistent with existing patterns (Musoq.Parser/Lexing/Lexer.cs).
- Ensured `LEFT/RIGHT JOIN` shorthand is accepted by updating join regex definitions (Musoq.Parser/Lexing/Lexer.cs).
- Aligned apply/order regex spacing with existing style for consistency (Musoq.Parser/Lexing/Lexer.cs).
- Added parser tests covering `JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` shorthand syntaxes (Musoq.Parser.Tests/ParserTests.cs).
- Added parser test for `RIGHT JOIN` shorthand (Musoq.Parser.Tests/ParserTests.cs).
- Added evaluator tests verifying `JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` shorthand execution (Musoq.Evaluator.Tests/JoinTests.cs).

## Current Status
- Build status: Not run in final iteration (previous full build passed earlier in session).
- Test status: `dotnet test Musoq.Parser.Tests --configuration Release` (pass); `dotnet test Musoq.Evaluator.Tests --configuration Release --filter "ClassName=Musoq.Evaluator.Tests.JoinTests"` (pass).
- Known issues: None.

## Next Steps
- If further consistency changes to regex patterns are desired, review remaining multi-word token definitions.
- Consider running the full test suite if broader changes are made beyond parser regex updates.

## Context Notes
- Bare `JOIN` is intentionally treated as `INNER JOIN`; comments in Lexer.cs describe the spacing expectations.
