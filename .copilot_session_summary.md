# Copilot Session Summary

## Last Updated
September 02, 2025 - Session: version-bump-test-investigation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Investigated test failure report from @Puchaczov
- [x] Ran complete test suite - All 1344 tests pass, 2 skipped, 0 failed
- [x] Checked for version-related test failures 
- [x] Identified potential runtime version dependency in DescEntityTest
- [x] Verified .NET runtime version strings match expected format
- [x] Confirmed all version bump changes are working correctly

## Current Status
- Build status: Success (no build errors)
- Test status: All tests pass locally (1344 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed)
- Known issues: No test failures detected in local environment

## Analysis Results
**Version Bump Changes Made:**
- Musoq.Parser: 4.4.0 → 4.5.0 ✅
- Musoq.Evaluator: 8.2.0 → 8.3.0 ✅  
- Musoq.Converter: 4.2.0 → 4.3.0 ✅
- Musoq.Schema: 8.2.0 → 8.3.0 ✅
- Musoq.Plugins: 6.11.0 → 6.12.0 ✅

**Test Investigation:**
- All tests pass in local Ubuntu environment with .NET 8.0.19
- Found one test (DescEntityTest) that checks runtime type strings including version numbers
- Runtime version check expects: `System.Nullable\`1[[System.Int32, System.Private.CoreLib, Version=8.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e]]`
- Actual runtime provides exactly this format - test should pass
- No hardcoded Musoq version checks found in tests

## Next Steps
- [x] Requested clarification from @Puchaczov about specific failing test
- [ ] If CI failure, need specific error message or log to investigate
- [ ] If different environment issue, may need environment-specific investigation

## Context Notes
**Possible Causes for Reported Test Failure:**
1. **CI Environment Difference**: Test may fail in Windows CI environment but pass locally
2. **Timing/Race Condition**: Intermittent test failure not reproduced locally  
3. **Dependency Version Mismatch**: Different .NET runtime version in CI
4. **Build Cache Issue**: CI might have stale build artifacts
5. **Specific Test Filter**: Different test selection in CI vs local run

**Recommendation**: Need specific test name and error message to proceed with targeted fix.
