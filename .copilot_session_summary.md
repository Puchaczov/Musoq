# Copilot Session Summary

## Last Updated
January 09, 2025 - Session: fix-77e5b637-5763-47af-adfb-618e5b07d8f1

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Reproduced the implicit boolean conversion issue with Match function in case when expressions
- [x] Created comprehensive test cases that cover all scenarios (WHERE with explicit/implicit, CASE WHEN with explicit/implicit)
- [x] Identified the root cause: `Visit(WhenNode node)` in `RewriteQueryVisitor.cs` was not applying nullable boolean rewriting
- [x] Implemented the minimal fix by adding `QueryRewriteUtilities.RewriteNullableBoolExpressions()` to WhenNode visitor
- [x] Verified the fix works - all new tests pass
- [x] Confirmed no regressions - all 1344 existing tests still pass

## Current Status
- Build status: Success (no build errors)
- Test status: All tests pass (1344 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed)
- Known issues: None

## Files Modified
- `Musoq.Evaluator.Tests/ImplicitBooleanConversionTests.cs` - Added comprehensive test cases
- `Musoq.Evaluator/Visitors/RewriteQueryVisitor.cs` - Fixed WhenNode visitor to apply nullable bool rewriting

## Next Steps
- None - issue is completely resolved

## Context Notes
**Root Cause Analysis:**
- WHERE clauses worked because `Visit(WhereNode node)` applied `QueryRewriteUtilities.RewriteNullableBoolExpressions()`
- CASE WHEN failed because `Visit(WhenNode node)` did NOT apply the same rewriting
- The `Match()` function returns `bool?` which needs conversion to `bool` for boolean contexts

**The Fix:**
Applied the same nullable boolean expression rewriting to WhenNode that was already applied to WhereNode:

```csharp
public void Visit(WhenNode node)
{
    var expression = Nodes.Pop();
    var rewrittenExpression = QueryRewriteUtilities.RewriteNullableBoolExpressions(expression);
    Nodes.Push(new WhenNode(rewrittenExpression));
}
```

This is a minimal, surgical change that resolves the issue without affecting any other functionality.
