# Copilot Session Summary

## Last Updated
September 02, 2025 - Session: version-bump-parallelization-fix

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Investigated test failure report from @Puchaczov
- [x] Ran complete test suite - All 1344 tests pass, 2 skipped, 0 failed
- [x] Checked for version-related test failures 
- [x] Identified potential runtime version dependency in DescEntityTest
- [x] Verified .NET runtime version strings match expected format
- [x] Confirmed all version bump changes are working correctly
- [x] **Fixed non-deterministic test ordering in ImplicitBooleanConversionTests**
- [x] **Added ORDER BY clauses to resolve parallelization issues**
- [x] **Updated test assertions to match deterministic ordering**
- [x] **Verified all ImplicitBooleanConversionTests pass with fix**
- [x] **Confirmed full test suite continues to pass (1344 passed, 2 skipped)**

## Current Status
- Build status: Success (no build errors)
- Test status: All tests pass (1344 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed)
- Known issues: **RESOLVED** - Parallelization ordering issue fixed
- PR status: All requested changes completed

## Analysis Results
**Version Bump Changes Made:**
- Musoq.Parser: 4.4.0 → 4.5.0 ✅
- Musoq.Evaluator: 8.2.0 → 8.3.0 ✅  
- Musoq.Converter: 4.2.0 → 4.3.0 ✅
- Musoq.Schema: 8.2.0 → 8.3.0 ✅
- Musoq.Plugins: 6.11.0 → 6.12.0 ✅

**Test Parallelization Fix:**
- Fixed `WhenCaseWhenUsedWithExplicitTrueComparison_ShouldWork` test
- Fixed `WhenCaseWhenUsedWithImplicitBooleanConversion_ShouldWork` test  
- Added `ORDER BY Name` clauses to ensure deterministic row ordering
- Updated assertions to expect "NoNumbers" before "Test123" (alphabetical order)
- Issue was: Tests expected specific row order but parallelization made order non-deterministic
- Solution: Added ORDER BY to guarantee consistent ordering regardless of parallel execution

## Next Steps
- [x] Addressed @Puchaczov comment about parallelization issue
- [x] Fixed all implicit operator tests as requested
- [x] Replied to comment with fix details and commit hash

## Context Notes
**Root Cause of Test Failure:**
- ImplicitBooleanConversionTests were failing due to non-deterministic row ordering
- With parallelization, "Test123" and "NoNumbers" entities could be processed in any order
- Tests assumed "Test123" would always come first (`table[0]`)
- Adding `ORDER BY Name` ensures "NoNumbers" always comes before "Test123" alphabetically

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified SQL queries in both failing tests to include `ORDER BY Name`
- Updated test assertions to match the deterministic alphabetical order
- All 4 ImplicitBooleanConversionTests now pass consistently
- No other tests affected by this change
