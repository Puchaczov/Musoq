# Copilot Session Summary

## Last Updated
[Current Timestamp]

## Completed Tasks
- Implemented type aliases (`int`, `string`) in generated code to replace `System.Int32`, `System.String`.
- Removed redundant casts in generated code.
- Added comments for fields in generated row classes (`// a.Name`).
- Implemented `EvaluationHelper.FlattenContexts` to simplify context array merging and reduce boilerplate.
- Configured Roslyn `Formatter` with specific options (`NewLinesForBracesInControlBlocks`, etc.) to improve code readability.
- Updated `ToCSharpRewriteTreeVisitor` to use `Dictionary` and `List` instead of fully qualified names for Hash Join.
- Manually formatted and updated `optimization_report.md` to reflect the "beautiful" generated code (indentation, newlines, simplified types).
- Verified changes with `Musoq.Evaluator.Tests` (1657 tests passed).

## Current Status
- Build status: Success
- Test status: 1657 tests passed, 0 failed.
- Known issues: None.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with Step 2: Implement Pipelining (Lazy Evaluation) as planned in `optimization_report.md`.

## Context Notes
- The generated code is now much cleaner and easier to debug.
- `optimization_report.md` serves as a good reference for the expected output of the query engine.
