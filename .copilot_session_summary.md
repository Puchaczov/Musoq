# Copilot Session Summary

## Last Updated
August 22, 2025 - Session continuation working on cross-syntax SQL feature testing

## Completed Tasks
- **Added window function token support**: Created OVER, RECURSIVE, PARTITION, BY tokens with proper TokenType enum definitions
- **Enhanced lexer infrastructure**: Added new tokens to regex definitions, token creation switch, and keyword recognition
- **Created parser nodes**: Implemented WindowFunctionNode and OverClauseNode for AST representation
- **Extended parser logic**: Added ComposeAccessMethodOrWindowFunction() and ComposeOverClause() methods
- **Updated visitor interface**: Added Visit methods for new node types
- **Modified function parsing**: Enhanced ComposeBaseTypes() to detect OVER clauses after function calls

## Current Status
- **Build status**: Parser compiles successfully, but evaluator fails due to missing visitor implementations
- **Test status**: Window function tests still fail with token recognition issues
- **Known issues**: 
  - New tokens (OVER, PARTITION, BY, RECURSIVE) return TokenType.None instead of proper types
  - Window functions fail with "Expected token is From but received Identifier" 
  - Token boundary regex patterns may need adjustment

## Next Steps
1. **Debug token recognition issue** - investigate why Format(Keyword, TokenText) patterns don't match
2. **Add placeholder visitor methods** - implement Visit(WindowFunctionNode) and Visit(OverClauseNode) in all visitor classes
3. **Test recursive CTE support** - verify RECURSIVE keyword handling in WITH clauses
4. **Complete window function parsing** - ensure OVER (ORDER BY x) and OVER (PARTITION BY x ORDER BY y) work
5. **Create comprehensive edge case tests** - systematic testing of complex SQL feature combinations

## Context Notes
- **Token implementation follows existing patterns** but lexer may require additional configuration
- **Window functions infrastructure is complete** - just need token recognition fix
- **User requested to "proceed"** - continue enhancing cross-syntax feature testing as originally planned
- **Parser architecture supports window functions** - AST nodes and parsing methods are ready
- **Focus on SQL compliance gaps** - window functions and recursive CTEs are major missing features

## Technical Details
- Added tokens: TokenType.Over, TokenType.Recursive, TokenType.Partition, TokenType.By
- Modified files: Parser.cs, Lexer.cs, TokenType.cs, IExpressionVisitor.cs
- New files: WindowFunctionNode.cs, OverToken.cs, RecursiveToken.cs, PartitionToken.cs, ByToken.cs
- Test files: WindowFunctionTokenTests.cs, TokenDebugTests.cs for debugging

The foundation for advanced SQL features is in place. Next session should focus on resolving token recognition to enable full testing of window function and recursive CTE support.
