# Copilot Session Summary

## Last Updated
2025-01-27 10:45:00 - Comprehensive test suite created

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed Musoq codebase structure and architecture
- [x] Reviewed existing parser, evaluator, and test patterns
- [x] Studied how complex SQL features (CTEs, GROUP BY, JOINs) are implemented
- [x] Identified test frameworks and patterns used in the project
- [x] Designed comprehensive test strategy for PIVOT implementation
- [x] Created SalesEntity test data model for PIVOT scenarios
- [x] Created parser tests for PIVOT syntax validation (PivotParserTests.cs)
- [x] Created evaluator tests for PIVOT functionality (PivotEvaluatorTests.cs)
- [x] Created advanced PIVOT scenario tests (PivotAdvancedTests.cs)
- [x] Created error handling tests for PIVOT edge cases (PivotErrorHandlingTests.cs)
- [x] Committed comprehensive test suite

## Current Status
- Build status: Partially compiling - some errors due to missing PIVOT implementation
- Test status: Comprehensive test suite created, ready for implementation
- Known issues: Compilation errors expected since PIVOT functionality not yet implemented

## Next Steps
- [ ] Fix remaining compilation errors in test suite
- [ ] Create PIVOT token and lexer support in Parser
- [ ] Implement PivotNode AST node and parser grammar changes
- [ ] Implement schema and type system changes for dynamic columns
- [ ] Implement converter/code generation for PIVOT transformation
- [ ] Implement evaluator runtime PIVOT logic
- [ ] Run tests to validate implementation

## Context Notes
- Created comprehensive test suite covering all PIVOT scenarios:
  - Basic static PIVOT (hardcoded column values)
  - Dynamic PIVOT (CTE-based column discovery)
  - Multiple aggregation functions (Sum, Count, Avg, etc.)
  - Integration with existing SQL clauses (WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING)
  - Complex scenarios (JOINs, subqueries, nested CTEs)
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Performance testing with large datasets
- Test design follows Musoq patterns using schema providers and test entities
- SalesEntity model provides realistic PIVOT test data (categories, products, quantities, revenue, dates, regions)
- All tests are designed to pass once PIVOT implementation is complete
- Ready to start implementing parser and runtime components
