# Copilot Session Summary

## Last Updated
2025-01-27 19:52:00 - MAJOR PROGRESS: Resolved symbol table null key issue, now working on type resolution

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed Musoq codebase structure and architecture
- [x] Reviewed existing parser, evaluator, and test patterns  
- [x] Studied how complex SQL features (CTEs, GROUP BY, JOINs) are implemented
- [x] Identified test frameworks and patterns used in the project
- [x] Designed comprehensive test strategy for PIVOT implementation
- [x] Created SalesEntity test data model for PIVOT scenarios
- [x] Created parser tests for PIVOT syntax validation (PivotParserTests.cs)
- [x] Created evaluator tests for PIVOT functionality (PivotEvaluatorTests.cs)
- [x] Created advanced PIVOT scenario tests (PivotAdvancedTests.cs)
- [x] Created error handling tests for PIVOT edge cases (PivotErrorHandlingTests.cs)
- [x] Fixed compilation errors in test suite
- [x] **Implemented PIVOT token support in lexer (PivotToken, ForToken)**
- [x] **Created PIVOT AST nodes (PivotNode, PivotFromNode)**
- [x] **Added PIVOT parsing logic to Parser.cs**
- [x] **Updated IExpressionVisitor interface for PIVOT nodes**
- [x] **Fixed PIVOT token recognition (const vs static string issue)**
- [x] **Fixed PIVOT parsing logic for identifier columns (ComposeBaseTypes vs ComposeWord)**
- [x] **Implemented comprehensive PIVOT visitor methods across 12 visitor classes**
- [x] **Successfully parsing PIVOT syntax - 12/15 parser tests passing (80%)**
- [x] **Implemented PIVOT metadata building infrastructure in BuildMetadataAndInferTypesVisitor**
- [x] **Fixed PIVOT traversal order in BuildMetadataAndInferTypesTraverseVisitor**
- [x] **Created PivotNodeProcessor class following GroupByNodeProcessor pattern**
- [x] **Implemented PIVOT transformation logic in ToCSharpRewriteTreeVisitor**
- [x] **Fixed metadata visitor stack management for composite FROM nodes**
- [x] **Resolved visitor pattern casting exceptions in PIVOT pipeline**
- [x] **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Fixed schema setup using proven GenericSchema pattern**
  - Simplified SalesSchemaProvider to use standard GenericSchema<SalesEntity, SalesEntityTable>
  - Removed complex custom library methods, using direct property access pattern
  - Fixed method naming (.data() vs .entities()) to match established schema patterns
- [x] **VALIDATED WORKING FOUNDATION:**
  - **Simple SELECT working**: `SELECT Category, Quantity FROM #A.entities()` executes successfully
  - **GROUP BY working**: `SELECT Category, Sum(Quantity) FROM #A.entities() GROUP BY Category` passes completely
  - **Aggregation functions confirmed**: Sum/Count/Avg properly accessible through LibraryBase inheritance
  - **Schema foundation solid**: SalesEntity properties accessible, field mapping working correctly

## Current Status
- Build status: **Successful** - all components compile cleanly  
- Parser tests: **12/15 passing (80%)** - core PIVOT syntax working excellently
- **Schema: FULLY VALIDATED** - Both simple SELECT and GROUP BY with SalesEntity working perfectly
- **Aggregation functions: CONFIRMED WORKING** - Sum/Count/Avg works correctly in standard SQL contexts
- **Symbol table context: RESOLVED** - No longer getting null identifier issues
- **Current issue: Type resolution in PIVOT aggregation context**
  - Error: `InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'WordNode' to type 'FromNode'`
  - Location: `ExpressionFromNode.Visit()` during PIVOT processing
  - Root cause: Changes to identifier resolution affecting visitor stack state

## Next Steps
- [ ] **FINAL PHASE: Complete PIVOT aggregation type resolution**
  - Current issue: Stack state disruption when enabling identifier resolution in PIVOT context
  - Approach: Need targeted fix for identifier type resolution without disrupting stack processing
  - Alternative: Implement PIVOT-specific identifier processing path
- [ ] **Complete PIVOT functionality validation**
  - Get first PIVOT evaluator test passing completely
  - Validate PIVOT result accuracy and column generation  
  - Test multiple aggregation scenarios
- [ ] Fix remaining 3 parser test edge cases (subqueries, JOIN integration, alias validation)

## Context Notes
- **SCHEMA BREAKTHROUGH**: Proven working with both simple SELECT and GROUP BY aggregation
- **Aggregation functions validated**: `Sum(Quantity)` works correctly in standard SQL contexts
- **Symbol table issue resolved**: Fixed null `_identifier` context resolution 
- **Current challenge**: Maintaining stack consistency while enabling PIVOT identifier resolution
- **Architecture proven**: GenericSchema pattern with LibraryBase integration works perfectly
- **High confidence for completion**: All major infrastructure working, only stack management issue remains
- **Clear debugging path**: Need targeted identifier resolution fix without stack disruption
