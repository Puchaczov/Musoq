# Copilot Session Summary

## Last Updated
2025-01-27 10:24:00 - Starting PIVOT implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed Musoq codebase structure and architecture
- [x] Reviewed existing parser, evaluator, and test patterns
- [x] Studied how complex SQL features (CTEs, GROUP BY, JOINs) are implemented
- [x] Identified test frameworks and patterns used in the project
- [x] Designed comprehensive test strategy for PIVOT implementation

## Current Status
- Build status: Not tested yet
- Test status: Creating test suite
- Known issues: None yet

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create comprehensive PIVOT test suite for Parser component
- [ ] Create comprehensive PIVOT test suite for Evaluator component  
- [ ] Implement PivotNode AST node and parser grammar changes
- [ ] Implement schema and type system changes for dynamic columns
- [ ] Implement converter/code generation for PIVOT
- [ ] Implement evaluator runtime PIVOT logic
- [ ] Run full test suite to validate implementation

## Context Notes
- PIVOT feature needs to support both static (hardcoded values) and dynamic (CTE-based) pivot columns
- Must integrate with existing aggregation engine (Sum, Count, Avg, etc.)
- Should follow existing patterns: BasicEntity test schema, visitor pattern, AST nodes
- Parser uses Lexer/Token approach, Evaluator uses CompiledQuery pattern
- Tests should cover syntax validation, execution correctness, edge cases, and integration scenarios
