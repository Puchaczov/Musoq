# Copilot Session Summary

## Last Updated
2025-01-27 20:20:00 - BREAKTHROUGH: Fixed symbol table registration, advanced to code generation phase

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed Musoq codebase structure and architecture
- [x] Reviewed existing parser, evaluator, and test patterns  
- [x] Studied how complex SQL features (CTEs, GROUP BY, JOINs) are implemented
- [x] Identified test frameworks and patterns used in the project
- [x] Designed comprehensive test strategy for PIVOT implementation
- [x] Created SalesEntity test data model for PIVOT scenarios
- [x] Created parser tests for PIVOT syntax validation (PivotParserTests.cs)
- [x] Created evaluator tests for PIVOT functionality (PivotEvaluatorTests.cs)
- [x] Created advanced PIVOT scenario tests (PivotAdvancedTests.cs)
- [x] Created error handling tests for PIVOT edge cases (PivotErrorHandlingTests.cs)
- [x] Fixed compilation errors in test suite
- [x] **Implemented PIVOT token support in lexer (PivotToken, ForToken)**
- [x] **Created PIVOT AST nodes (PivotNode, PivotFromNode)**
- [x] **Added PIVOT parsing logic to Parser.cs**
- [x] **Updated IExpressionVisitor interface for PIVOT nodes**
- [x] **Fixed PIVOT token recognition (const vs static string issue)**
- [x] **Fixed PIVOT parsing logic for identifier columns (ComposeBaseTypes vs ComposeWord)**
- [x] **Implemented comprehensive PIVOT visitor methods across 12 visitor classes**
- [x] **Successfully parsing PIVOT syntax - 12/15 parser tests passing (80%)**
- [x] **Implemented PIVOT metadata building infrastructure in BuildMetadataAndInferTypesVisitor**
- [x] **Fixed PIVOT traversal order in BuildMetadataAndInferTypesTraverseVisitor**
- [x] **Created PivotNodeProcessor class following GroupByNodeProcessor pattern**
- [x] **Implemented PIVOT transformation logic in ToCSharpRewriteTreeVisitor**
- [x] **Fixed metadata visitor stack management for composite FROM nodes**
- [x] **Resolved visitor pattern casting exceptions in PIVOT pipeline**
- [x] **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Fixed schema setup using proven GenericSchema pattern**
  - Simplified SalesSchemaProvider to use standard GenericSchema<SalesEntity, SalesEntityTable>
  - Removed complex custom library methods, using direct property access pattern
  - Fixed method naming (.data() vs .entities()) to match established schema patterns
- [x] **VALIDATED WORKING FOUNDATION:**
  - **Simple SELECT working**: `SELECT Category, Quantity FROM #A.entities()` executes successfully
  - **GROUP BY working**: `SELECT Category, Sum(Quantity) FROM #A.entities() GROUP BY Category` passes completely
  - **Aggregation functions confirmed**: Sum/Count/Avg properly accessible through LibraryBase inheritance
  - **Schema foundation solid**: SalesEntity properties accessible, field mapping working correctly
- [x] **Fixed symbol table context resolution issues:**
  - Resolved `ArgumentNullException` where `_identifier` was null during PIVOT processing
  - Fixed visitor traversal order to handle PIVOT context before aggregation expressions
  - Implemented proper identifier assignment in visitor methods
- [x] **Fixed stack management for PIVOT processing:**
  - Resolved `InvalidCastException` trying to cast `WordNode` to `FromNode`
  - Corrected visitor pattern for PivotFromNode to maintain stack consistency
  - Fixed stack state during aggregation processing
- [x] **Implemented PIVOT symbol table registration:**
  - Fixed `KeyNotFoundException` for PIVOT alias 'p' not being registered
  - Added proper TableSymbol registration for PIVOT aliases in symbol table
  - Ensured PIVOT aliases are accessible by outer query processing

## Current Status
- Build status: **Successful** - all components compile cleanly  
- Parser tests: **12/15 passing (80%)** - core PIVOT syntax working excellently
- **Schema: FULLY VALIDATED** - Both simple SELECT and GROUP BY with SalesEntity working perfectly
- **Aggregation functions: CONFIRMED WORKING** - Sum/Count/Avg works correctly in standard SQL contexts
- **Symbol table: FULLY RESOLVED** - All identifier and alias registration issues fixed
- **BREAKTHROUGH: Advanced to code generation phase**
  - Error: `KeyNotFoundException: The given key 'Quantity' was not present in the dictionary`
  - Location: `ToCSharpRewriteTreeVisitor.Visit(IdentifierNode)` during `Sum(Quantity)` processing
  - Status: Successfully passed metadata building, now in converter/code generation phase

## Next Steps
- [ ] **FINAL PHASE: Complete PIVOT code generation**
  - Current issue: IdentifierNode 'Quantity' not found during PIVOT aggregation code generation
  - Need: Ensure aggregation column identifiers are properly mapped in code generation context
  - Context: PIVOT processing in `ToCSharpRewriteTreeVisitor` for Sum(Quantity) expression
- [ ] **Complete PIVOT functionality validation**
  - Get first PIVOT evaluator test passing completely
  - Validate PIVOT result accuracy and column generation  
  - Test multiple aggregation scenarios
- [ ] Fix remaining 3 parser test edge cases (subqueries, JOIN integration, alias validation)

## Context Notes
- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: Successfully moved through all major infrastructure phases
  - âœ… Compilation â†’ âœ… Stack management â†’ âœ… Symbol table â†’ âœ… Identifier resolution â†’ ðŸ”„ Code generation
- **Proven working foundation**: Simple SELECT and GROUP BY with aggregations confirmed operational
- **Final integration challenge**: Code generation for PIVOT aggregation expressions
- **High confidence for completion**: All core infrastructure working, only code generation mapping remains
- **Clear path forward**: Fix identifier mapping in ToCSharpRewriteTreeVisitor for PIVOT context
