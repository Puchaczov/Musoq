## Last Updated  
2025-01-27 21:00:00 - üö® CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Debug tests "passing" due to commented Assert.Fail() - PIVOT NOT ACTUALLY WORKING

## Completed Tasks
- [x] **üîç IDENTIFIED ROOT CAUSE**: The debug tests appearing to "pass" are actually catching C# compilation exceptions but not failing the test (Assert.Fail() is commented out)
- [x] **üö® CONFIRMED ACTUAL STATUS**: ALL PIVOT tests are failing with same C# compilation errors - no PIVOT functionality is actually working 
- [x] **üéØ PINPOINTED EXACT C# ERRORS**:
  - CS1525: Invalid expression terminator "." (lines 30, 34)
  - CS0103: Name "var" doesn't exist (lines 29, 33)  
  - CS0128: Variable "InferredInfoTable", "Rows" redefinition (lines 32, 34)
  - CS0103: Name "pRows" doesn't exist (line 37)

## Current Status
- Build status: **Successful** - all components compile cleanly
- **PIVOT infrastructure: ‚ùå BROKEN** - C# code generation creates malformed syntax
- **Test results: 0/32 PIVOT tests actually working** (debug tests fail but don't assert)

**Critical insight**: The issue is NOT in:
- Variable registration pattern attempts  
- Column name resolution  
- PIVOT metadata building
- Method resolution

**Root cause**: Systematic C# code generation malformation that creates:
- Invalid "." expressions  
- Variable redefinition conflicts
- Missing variable declarations ("var" not found, "pRows" not found)

## Next Steps
- [ ] **üîß FIX C# SYNTAX GENERATION**: The core issue is malformed C# code being generated
- [ ] **üîç EXAMINE GENERATED CODE**: Look at actual generated C# to see malformed patterns
- [ ] **üõ†Ô∏è DEBUG CODE GENERATION PIPELINE**: Find where invalid syntax and variable conflicts are created
- [ ] **‚úÖ ENSURE SINGLE VARIABLE DECLARATION**: Fix variable redefinition by ensuring proper code generation flow

## Context Notes
- **False progress indicator**: Debug tests appearing to pass was misleading - they catch exceptions but don't fail
- **All tests failing identically**: The same C# compilation errors occur across all PIVOT test scenarios
- **Infrastructure complete**: Parser, AST nodes, visitor methods all implemented - issue is final C# generation phase
