# Copilot Session Summary

## Last Updated
2026-02-14 (GPT-5 Codex session, publish workflow release automation)

## Completed Tasks
- Reviewed `.github/workflows/publish.yml` and updated it to create a GitHub Release after NuGet publication.
- Updated workflow permissions from `contents: read` to `contents: write` to allow release creation.
- Added `Create GitHub Release` step using `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` and attached generated `.nupkg` files.
- Ran validation:
  - `dotnet restore src/dotnet/Musoq.sln`
  - `dotnet build src/dotnet/Musoq.sln --configuration Release --no-restore`
  - `dotnet test src/dotnet/Musoq.sln --configuration Release --no-build --verbosity normal`
  - `dotnet test src/dotnet/Musoq.sln --configuration Release --no-build --verbosity minimal`
  - YAML parse check for `.github/workflows/publish.yml` via Ruby `YAML.load_file`

## Current Status
- Build status: **Success**
- Test status: **Success** (latest run completed with passing tests; evaluator suite output showed 4571 passed, 10 skipped).
- Workflow status: `publish.yml` now includes post-NuGet release creation and uploads package artifacts.
- Known issues: none identified for this task.

## Next Steps
- Trigger `Publish` workflow in GitHub Actions to verify end-to-end behavior in CI:
  - packages are pushed/skipped successfully on NuGet
  - GitHub release is created with expected tag/name and `.nupkg` assets attached
- If desired, refine tag naming strategy to semantic version tags after confirming preferred release policy.

## Context Notes
- Release tags are currently generated from `github.run_id` and `github.run_attempt` to avoid collisions on re-runs.
- `softprops/action-gh-release` requires `contents: write`; no other workflow behavior was changed.
