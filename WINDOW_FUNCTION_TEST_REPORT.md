Parser tests mostly working with 2 edge case failures:
- Window frame parsing: PASSING
- Basic OVER clause syntax: PASSING
- Complex expressions: PASSING
- **FAILURES**: Quoted identifiers and excessive whitespace edge cases

### ❌ Musoq.Converter.Tests: 14/18 PASSING (78%)
Converter tests have 4 failures in arithmetic and complex expression handling:
- Basic window function conversion: PASSING
- Simple OVER clauses: PASSING
- **FAILURES**: Arithmetic expressions and complex expression compilation

## Overall Status: 70/76 Tests Passing (92%)

## Test Coverage Areas

### ✅ WORKING FEATURES
1. **Aggregate Window Functions**
   - `SUM(column) OVER (...)`
   - `COUNT(column) OVER (...)`
   - `AVG(column) OVER (...)`

2. **Basic Window Functions**
   - `RANK() OVER (...)`
   - `DENSE_RANK() OVER (...)`
   - `LAG(column, offset, default) OVER (...)`
   - `LEAD(column, offset, default) OVER (...)`

3. **Window Specifications**
   - `PARTITION BY column(s)`
   - `ORDER BY column(s) ASC/DESC`
   - Empty OVER clauses: `OVER ()`

4. **Advanced SQL Features**
   - Window functions in JOINs
   - Window functions in CTEs
   - Window functions in subqueries
   - Mixed window and regular functions
   - Complex WHERE clauses

### ⚠️ ISSUES TO RESOLVE

#### Parser Issues (2 failures)
1. **Quoted identifier handling** in window contexts
2. **Excessive whitespace** parsing edge cases

#### Converter Issues (4 failures)
1. **Arithmetic expressions** within window functions
2. **Complex expression compilation** for window contexts
3. **Method resolution** for compound expressions
4. **Type inference** edge cases

## Thorough Testing Validation

### Current Test Suite Coverage:
