Musoq brings SQL power to your data, wherever it lives. Query files, directories, CSVs, and more with familiar SQL syntax ‚Äì no database required.

## üåü Key Features

- **Versatility:** Data sources come as plugins. Visit the [Musoq.DataSources](https://github.com/Puchaczov/Musoq.DataSources) repository where they are all stored..
- **SQL Syntax Variant:** The engine uses SQL syntax variant with support for complex queries.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Linux, Windows, and Docker. MacOS compatibility is anticipated.
- **In-place querying without data movement:** Query data where it resides, without the need to move or load it into a central data store.
- **Extensible architecture for custom data sources:** Add support for custom data sources through a plugin architecture.

## üöÄ Quick Start

To try out Musoq, follow the instructions in our [CLI repository](https://github.com/Puchaczov/Musoq.CLI).

## üí° Example Queries

Musoq can handle a wide variety of data sources. Here are some examples:

```sql
-- Look for files greater than 1 gig
SELECT 
	FullName 
FROM #os.files('', true) 
WHERE ToDecimal(Length) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 > 1

-- Look for how many space does the extensions occupies within some directory
SELECT
    Extension,
    Round(Sum(Length) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024, 1) as SpaceOccupiedInGB,
    Count(Extension) as HowManyFiles
FROM #os.files('/some/directory', true)
GROUP BY Extension
HAVING Round(Sum(Length) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024, 1) > 0

-- Get first, last 5 bits from files and consecutive 10 bytes of file with offset of 5 from tail
SELECT
	ToHex(Head(5), '|'),
	ToHex(Tail(5), '|'),
	ToHex(GetFileBytes(10, 5), '|')
FROM #os.files('/some/directory', false)

-- Describe images using AI
SELECT
    llava.DescribeImage(photo.Base64File()),
    photo.FullName
FROM #os.files('/path/to/directory', false) photo 
INNER JOIN #ollama.models('llava:13b', 0.0) llava ON 1 = 1

-- Count tokens in Markdown and C files
SELECT 
   SUM(gpt.CountTokens(f.GetFileContent())) AS TokensCount 
FROM #os.files('/path/to/directory', true) f 
INNER JOIN #openai.gpt('gpt-4') gpt ON 1 = 1 
WHERE f.Extension IN ('.md', '.c')

-- Query CAN DBC files
SELECT  
    ID,
    Name,
    DLC,
    CycleTime
FROM #can.messages('./file.dbc')

-- Compare two directories
SELECT 
    (CASE WHEN SourceFile IS NOT NULL 
     THEN SourceFileRelative 
     ELSE DestinationFileRelative 
     END) AS FullName, 
    (CASE WHEN State = 'TheSame' 
     THEN 'The Same' 
     ELSE State 
     END) AS Status 
FROM #os.dirscompare('E:\DiffDirsTests\A', 'E:\DiffDirsTests\B')

-- Find large files
SELECT 
    FullName 
FROM #os.files('', true) 
WHERE ToDecimal(Length) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 > 1

-- Compute sentiment on a comments
SELECT 
    csv.PostId,
    csv.Comment,
    gpt.Sentiment(csv.Comment) as Sentiment,
    csv.Date
FROM #separatedvalues.csv('/home/somebody/comments_sample.csv', true, 0) csv
INNER JOIN #openai.gpt('gpt-4-1106-preview') gpt on 1 = 1

-- Query CAN DBC file (messages)
SELECT  
    ID,
    Name,
    DLC,
    CycleTime
FROM #can.messages('./file.dbc')

-- Get only files that extension is .png or .jpg
SELECT 
    FullName 
FROM #os.files('C:/Some/Path/To/Dir', true) 
WHERE Extension = '.png' OR Extension = '.jpg'

-- Group by directory and show size of each
SELECT
	DirectoryName,
	Sum(Length) / 1024 / 1024 as 'MB',
	Min(Length) as 'Min',
	Max(Length) as 'Max',
	Count(FullName) as 'CountOfFiles',
FROM #os.files('/some/path', true)
GROUP BY DirectoryName

-- Prints the values from 1 to 9
SELECT Value FROM #system.range(1, 10)
```

## üîß Syntax Features

Musoq supports a rich set of SQL-like features:

- Optional query reordering (FROM ... WHERE ... GROUP BY ... HAVING ... SELECT ... SKIP N TAKE N2)
- Use of `*` to select all columns
- GROUP BY and HAVING operators
- SKIP & TAKE operators
- Complex object accessing (`column.Name`)
- User-defined functions and aggregation functions
- Set operators (UNION, UNION ALL, EXCEPT, INTERSECT)
- Parameterizable sources
- LIKE / NOT LIKE operator
- RLIKE / NOT RLIKE operator (regex)
- CONTAINS operator
- CTE expressions
- DESC for schema, schema table constructors and tables
- IN syntax

## üèó Architecture

### High-level Overview
![Architecture Overview](https://github.com/Puchaczov/Musoq/blob/master/Musoq-Architecture-Engine.png)

### Plugins
Musoq offers a plugin API that all sources use. To learn how to implement your own plugin, you should examine how existing plugins are created.

## üí° Motivation

Developed out of a need for a versatile tool that could query various data sources with SQL syntax, Musoq aims to minimize the effort and time required for data querying and analysis.
